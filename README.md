# pokemon-analysis with PokeAPI

The Pokémon Data Analysis project aims to explore and analyze data related to Pokémon using the PokeAPI. This project involves fetching data for various Pokémon species, transforming it into a structured format, and then conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the characteristics of different Pokémon.

Project Components :-

1) Data Collection :-
 - Fetch data for a specified number of Pokémon species using the PokeAPI.
 - Extract relevant information such as name, base stats (HP, attack, defense, special attack, special defense, speed), types, abilities, weight, and height.

2) Data Transformation :-
 - Transform the raw JSON data into a structured format using Pandas DataFrame.
 - Ensure consistent data types for analysis.

3) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) :-
 - Analyze the distribution of Pokémon base stats (e.g., attack, defense).
 - Calculate average stats by Pokémon type.
 - Explore correlations between Pokémon height/weight and their stats.
 - Identify the most common abilities among Pokémon.
4) Visualization :-
 - Visualize the results of the EDA using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
 - Generate plots and charts to present insights and patterns.
